# Tautomer-Generator-with-AMBIT
Welcome to the Tautomer Generator!

This repository contains a script written in Java that utilizes the open-source library xxx to generate tautomers from a CSV file containing SMILES and molecule IDs. Additionally, the script generates a new CSV file containing all the input molecules and their associated tautomers. It also produces separate SDF files for each input molecule and its associated tautomers.
